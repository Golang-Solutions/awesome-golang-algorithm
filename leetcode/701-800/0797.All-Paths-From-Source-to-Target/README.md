# [797.All Paths From Source to Target][title]

## Description
Given a directed acyclic graph (**DAG**) of `n` nodes labeled from 0 to `n - 1`, find all possible paths from node `0` to node `n - 1` and return them in **any order**.

The graph is given as follows: `graph[i]` is a list of all nodes you can visit from node `i` (i.e., there is a directed edge from node i to node `graph[i][j]`).

**Example 1:**  

![example1](./all_1.jpg)

```
Input: graph = [[1,2],[3],[3],[]]
Output: [[0,1,3],[0,2,3]]
Explanation: There are two paths: 0 -> 1 -> 3 and 0 -> 2 -> 3.
```

**Example 2:**  

![example2](./all_2.jpg)

```
Input: graph = [[4,3,1],[3,2,4],[3],[4],[]]
Output: [[0,4],[0,3,4],[0,1,3,4],[0,1,2,3,4],[0,1,4]]
```
