# [1837.Sum of Digits in Base K][title]

## Description
Given an integer `n` (in base `10`) and a base `k`, return the **sum** of the digits of `n` **after** converting `n` from base `10` to base `k`.

After converting, each digit should be interpreted as a base `10` number, and the sum should be returned in base `10`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 34, k = 6
Output: 9
Explanation: 34 (base 10) expressed in base 6 is 54. 5 + 4 = 9.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 10, k = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: n is already in base 10. 1 + 0 = 1.
```
