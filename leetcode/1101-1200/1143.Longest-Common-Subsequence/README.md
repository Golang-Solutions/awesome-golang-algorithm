# [1143.Longest Common Subsequence][title]

## Description
Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest **common subsequence**. If there is no **common subsequence**, return `0`.

A `subsequence` of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

- For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.

A **common subsequence** of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
```
