# [401.Binary Watch][title]

## Description
A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top which represent the hours (0-11), and the 6 LEDs on the bottom represent the minutes (0-59). Each LED represents a zero or one, with the least significant bit on the right.

- For example, the below binary watch reads `"4:51"`  
![watch](./binarywatch.jpg)

Given an integer `turnedOn` which represents the number of LEDs that are currently on, return all possible times the watch could represent. You may return the answer in **any order**.

The hour must not contain a leading zero.

- For example, `"01:00"` is not valid. It should be `"1:00"`.

The minute must be consist of two digits and may contain a leading zero.

- For example, `"10:2"` is not valid. It should be `"10:02"`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: turnedOn = 1
Output: ["0:01","0:02","0:04","0:08","0:16","0:32","1:00","2:00","4:00","8:00"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: turnedOn = 9
Output: []
```
