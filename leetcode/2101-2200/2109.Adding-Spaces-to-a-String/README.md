# [2109.Adding Spaces to a String][title]

## Description
You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` and a **0-indexed** integer array `spaces` that describes the indices in the original string where spaces will be added. Each space should be inserted **before** the character at the given index.

- For example, given `s = "EnjoyYourCoffee"` and `spaces = [5, 9]`, we place spaces before `'Y'` and `'C'`, which are at indices `5` and `9` respectively. Thus, we obtain `"Enjoy Your Coffee"`.

Return the modified string **after** the spaces have been added.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "LeetcodeHelpsMeLearn", spaces = [8,13,15]
Output: "Leetcode Helps Me Learn"
Explanation: 
The indices 8, 13, and 15 correspond to the underlined characters in "LeetcodeHelpsMeLearn".
We then place spaces before those characters.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "icodeinpython", spaces = [1,5,7,9]
Output: "i code in py thon"
Explanation:
The indices 1, 5, 7, and 9 correspond to the underlined characters in "icodeinpython".
We then place spaces before those characters.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "spacing", spaces = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: " s p a c i n g"
Explanation:
We are also able to place spaces before the first character of the string.
```
