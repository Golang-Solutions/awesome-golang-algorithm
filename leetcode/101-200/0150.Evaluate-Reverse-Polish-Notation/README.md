# [150.Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation][title]

## Description
Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in [Reverse Polish Notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse\_Polish\_notation).

Valid operators are `+`, `-`,`*`, and `/`. Each operand may be an integer or another expression.

**Note** that division between two integers should truncate toward zero.

It is guaranteed that the given RPN expression is always valid. That means the expression would always evaluate to a result, and there will not be any division by zero operation.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]
Output: 9
Explanation: ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]
Output: 6
Explanation: (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]
Output: 22
Explanation: ((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5
= (0 + 17) + 5
= 17 + 5
= 22
```
