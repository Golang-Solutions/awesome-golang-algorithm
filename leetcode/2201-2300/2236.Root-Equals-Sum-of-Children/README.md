# [2236.Root Equals Sum of Children][title]

## Description
You are given the `root` of a **binary tree** that consists of exactly `3` nodes: the root, its left child, and its right child.

Return `true` if the value of the root is equal to the **sum** of the values of its two children, or `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**  

![tree1](./graph3drawio.png)
```
Input: root = [10,4,6]
Output: true
Explanation: The values of the root, its left child, and its right child are 10, 4, and 6, respectively.
10 is equal to 4 + 6, so we return true.
```

**Example 2:**  
![tree2](./graph3drawio-1.png)
```
Input: root = [5,3,1]
Output: false
Explanation: The values of the root, its left child, and its right child are 5, 3, and 1, respectively.
5 is not equal to 3 + 1, so we return false.
```
