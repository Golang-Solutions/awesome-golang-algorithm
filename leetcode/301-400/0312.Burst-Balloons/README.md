# [312.Burst Balloons][title]

## Description
You are given `n` balloons, indexed from `0` to `n - 1`. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by an array `nums`. You are asked to burst all the balloons.

If you burst the i<sup>th</sup> balloon, you will get `nums[i - 1] * nums[i] * nums[i + 1]` coins. If `i - 1` or `i + 1` goes out of bounds of the array, then treat it as if there is a balloon with a `1` painted on it.

Return the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.  

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,1,5,8]
Output: 167
Explanation:
nums = [3,1,5,8] --> [3,5,8] --> [3,8] --> [8] --> []
coins =  3*1*5    +   3*5*8   +  1*3*8  + 1*8*1 = 167
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,5]
Output: 10
```
