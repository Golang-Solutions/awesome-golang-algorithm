# [1464.Maximum Product of Two Elements in an Array][title]

## Description
Given an binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, return `true` if all `1's` are at least `k` places away from each other, otherwise return `false`.


**Example 1:**  
![example1](./sample_1_1791.png)

```
Input: nums = [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1], k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Each of the 1s are at least 2 places away from each other.
```

**Example 2:**  
![example2](./sample_2_1791.png)

```
Input: nums = [1,0,0,1,0,1], k = 2
Output: false
