# [687.Longest Univalue Path][title]

## Description
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the length of the longest path, where each node in the path has the same value. This path may or may not pass through the root.

**The length of the path** between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

**Example 1:**  
![ex1](./ex1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [5,4,5,1,1,null,5]
Output: 2
Explanation: The shown image shows that the longest path of the same value (i.e. 5).
```

**Example 2:**  
![ex2](./ex2.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,4,5,4,4,null,5]
Output: 2
Explanation: The shown image shows that the longest path of the same value (i.e. 4).
```
