# [673.Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence][title]

## Description
Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of longest increasing subsequences.

__Notice__ that the sequence has to be __strictly__ increasing.


**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequences are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.
```
