# [1926.Nearest Exit from Entrance in Maze][title]

## Description
You are given an `m x n` matrix `maze` (**0-indexed**) with empty cells (represented as `'.'`) and walls (represented as `'+'`). You are also given the `entrace` of the maze, where entrance = [entrance<sub>row</sub>, entrance<sub>col</sub>] denotes the row and column of the cell you are initially standing at.

In one step, you can move one cell **up**, **down**, **left**, or **right**. You cannot step into a cell with a wall, and you cannot step outside the maze. Your goal is to find the **nearest exit** from the entrance. An **exit** is defined as an **empty cell** that is at the **border** of the `maze`. The `entrace` **does not count** as an exit.

Return the **number of steps** in the shortest path from the `entrace` to the nearest exit, or -1 if no such path exists.


**Example 1:**  
![example1](./nearest1-grid.jpg)

```
Input: maze = [["+","+",".","+"],[".",".",".","+"],["+","+","+","."]], entrance = [1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: There are 3 exits in this maze at [1,0], [0,2], and [2,3].
Initially, you are at the entrance cell [1,2].
- You can reach [1,0] by moving 2 steps left.
- You can reach [0,2] by moving 1 step up.
It is impossible to reach [2,3] from the entrance.
Thus, the nearest exit is [0,2], which is 1 step away.
```

**Example 2:**  
![example2](./nearesr2-grid.jpg)

```
Input: maze = [["+","+","+"],[".",".","."],["+","+","+"]], entrance = [1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: There is 1 exit in this maze at [1,2].
[1,0] does not count as an exit since it is the entrance cell.
Initially, you are at the entrance cell [1,0].
- You can reach [1,2] by moving 2 steps right.
Thus, the nearest exit is [1,2], which is 2 steps away.
```

**Example 3:**  
![example3](./nearest3-grid.jpg)

```
Input: maze = [[".","+"]], entrance = [0,0]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no exits in this maze.
```
