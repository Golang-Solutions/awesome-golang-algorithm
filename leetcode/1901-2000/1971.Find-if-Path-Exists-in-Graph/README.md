# [1971.Find if Path Exists in Graph][title]

## Description
There is a **bi-directional** graph with `n` vertices, where each vertex is labeled from `0` to `n - 1` (**inclusive**). The edges in the graph are represented as a 2D integer array `edges`, where each `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` denotes a bi-directional edge between vertex u<sub>i</sub> and vertex v<sub>i</sub>. Every vertex pair is connected by **at most one** edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself.

You want to determine if there is a **valid path** that exists from vertex `source` to vertex `destination`.

Given `edges` and the integers `n`, `source`, and `destination`, return `true` if there is a **valid path** from `source` to `destination`, or `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**  

![example1](./validpath-ex1.png)

```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0]], source = 0, destination = 2
Output: true
Explanation: There are two paths from vertex 0 to vertex 2:
- 0 → 1 → 2
- 0 → 2
```

**Example 2:**  

![example2](./validpath-ex2.png)

```
Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[3,5],[5,4],[4,3]], source = 0, destination = 5
Output: false
Explanation: There is no path from vertex 0 to vertex 5.
```
