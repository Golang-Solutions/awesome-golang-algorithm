# [872.Leaf-Similar Trees][title]

## Description
Consider all the leaves of a binary tree, from left to right order, the values of those leaves form a **leaf value sequence**.  
![tree1](./tree.png)

For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is `(6, 7, 4, 9, 8)`.

Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.

Return `true` if and only if the two given trees with head nodes `root1` and `root2` are leaf-similar.


**Example 1:**  
![tree2](./leaf-similar-1.jpg)

```
Input: root1 = [3,5,1,6,2,9,8,null,null,7,4], root2 = [3,5,1,6,7,4,2,null,null,null,null,null,null,9,8]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**  
![tree3](./leaf-similar-2.jpg)

```
Input: root1 = [1,2,3], root2 = [1,3,2]
Output: false
```
